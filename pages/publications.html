      <h2>Publications</h2>
      <p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of Malan: A Historical Novel of the Lambadis, authored by Prof. N. Shanthanaik from Vijayanagara Shri Krishnadevaraya University. This novel fills a significant gap in literature, as there are few works of fiction that delve into the lives of the Lambadis, an indigenous community with a rich cultural heritage. Malan not only presents a captivating fictional narrative but also offers a deep exploration of the cultural realities faced by the Lambadis. In the absence of extensive mainstream historical records, fiction like Malan serves as a powerful tool to illuminate the lived experiences and traditions of marginalized communities. Through its vivid storytelling, the novel brings to life the struggles, triumphs, and enduring spirit of the Lambadi people, making it an essential read for anyone interested in understanding the nuances of this unique cultural group.</p>
